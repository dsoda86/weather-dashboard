# Weather Dashboard

## Description
This weather dashboard application was created so that travelers or simply curious users could enter a desired city and find out the weather and 5 day forecast of that city.
The application uses HTML, CSS / Bootstrap, Javascript, and the OpenWeather API and functions with local storage that will save and display previously searched cities.
With this project I learned a lot about the OpenWeather API and how to set up a key and use it API parameters to get the desired information.


## Usage
 The user can enter a city name and it will search for and match the closest city with that name. It will provide current conditions in addition to a 5-day forecast. If it cannot find the city, it will alert the user. It will store the city in a list on the left side and as the user searches for more cities, they will be added to the list. The user is able to click cities that appear on the list to switch between them.
